This project contains a [Play Scala](https://www.playframework.com/) based implementation of the [Atlassian Connect](https://connect.atlassian.com/) framework. It serves as a starter for building Atlassian Connect add-ons for JIRA and Confluence.

## Quick start

atlassian-connect-play is published to Maven Central for Scala 2.11 so you can just add the following to your build:

    libraryDependencies += "io.toolsplus" %% "atlassian-connect-play" % "0.0.2"

## Basics

To get started, there are two options. You can generate a fresh project by cloning the seed project, which
will provide you with the basic project structure. Alternatively if you have an existing Scala project, you can manually
add a the framework dependency to your project to turn it into an Atlassian Connect add-on.

### Creating a project from the seed project

The easiest way to get started is by cloning the [Atlassian Connect Play Seed](atlassian-connect-play-seed) 
project.
